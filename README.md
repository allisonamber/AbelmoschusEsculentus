# The Fighting Okra
Delta State University in Mississippi has an unusual mascot: the “Fighting Okra.” Previously, DSU’s mascot had been the “Statesman.” Yet students insisted on having a mascot that they thought better represented their southern roots and the toughness of their athletes. [^Ref 1] Today, DSU has proudly made the Fighting Okra the face of its campus, with promotional materials proclaiming somewhat tongue in cheek, “Fear of the Okra may not be actual fear, but it’s enough to get a crowd going.” [^Ref 2]  Although the link between okra, the South, and toughness may seem obscure,  the okra has been not just a vegetable but a source and symbol of strength for many disenfranchised communities and particularly members of the African diaspora in the Americas. In fact, videos such as the one depicting the Fighting Okra pushing a DSU swimmer into shortening her lap time epitomize the mythos surrounding the okra. Okra has developed a reputation as a “robust, productive, fast-growing, [and] high yielding [crop]... [one that is] seldom felled by pests and diseases. It adapts to difficult conditions and can thrive where other food plants prove unreliable.” [^Ref 3] More broadly, it has served as an example of and testament to cultural resilience, as Africans forcibly displaced by the slave trade kept growing and cooking okra and preserving, as well as innovating, their culinary traditions. Thus, the crop has evolved into a cultural phenomenon that communities around the world continue to ‘stick to’ as a treasured reminder of home, heritage, and enduring spirit.

# Origins
Okra (from the Igbo word okuru), [^Ref 4] also known by its scientific name Abelmoschus esculentus, is a cultigen or plant species that humans have selected for cultivation with no clearly discernible wild ancestor. Okra hails from the Mallow family, sharing ties with plants such as cotton and members of the hibiscus genus. [^Ref 5] In terms of floral anatomy, okra very closely resembles various hibiscus species, and it was often mistaken as a type of hibiscus in early botanical texts. Okra rises from the ground and branches into green leaves and pale yellow and red flowers, complemented by long green or red fruit pods that hold seeds within. The plant’s original zone of cultivation is based in the tropics and subtropics of the eastern hemisphere, extending from Southeast Asia to West Africa. In terms of its precise origins, scientists have often theorized it to be the descendant of an older species originating in either East Africa or South and Southeast Asia. Chris Smith suggests that the Asian origin story is the more likely one, as the “wild relative” of okra to which its East African origin is often attributed also grew in adjacent regions of Asia in prehistory. [^Ref 6] Regardless, African communities extending from the Horn of Africa to the shores of West Africa have cultivated the plant for thousands of years. From Africa, we can trace okra’s journey from prehistoric cultivation to an international symbol of African diasporic survival and cultural continuity.

# Crossing Borders
Okra's historical basis in Africa begins with its first appearance in the written record through the Arabic language as bamiya in Ibn al-Baytar’s 1216 pharmaceutical text Kitab al-Jamiʿ li-Mufradat al-Adwiya wa-l-Aghdhiya. In this text, Al-Baytar compiled a catalog of 1400 plants, including information about their characteristics and their traditional uses. For okra’s description, Al-Baytar referenced the words of his teacher, Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, who encountered the vegetable on a visit to Egypt in 1216 CE. [^Ref 7] He compared the plant and its “black” and “sweet” fruit to hibiscus trees in Al-Andalus. This comparison was particularly inspired by the red center that both flowers share, as well as the shape and form of the flowers themselves. The okra description ends with a culinary emphasis, describing how “the people of Egypt'' ate and prepared bamiya with meat and “hot spices.” [^Ref 8] Today, a comparable dish called bamiya (in Egypt and Western Asia) or ganaouiya (in Northwest Africa) is still cooked and eaten. In this enduring culinary tradition, cooks continue to pair the vegetable with protein in a slow-cooked and highly spiced stew.

Okra’s journey from Africa to the Americas began in the decades following Columbus’ 1492 arrival in the Americas and the subsequent establishment of European colonies. From that period onward, European traders began buying captured Africans and forcibly displacing them to the Americas during the transatlantic slave trade, [^Ref 9] with the first documented transport leaving Africa and arriving in the Americas in 1525. [^Ref 10] The harrowing journey from Africa to the Americas would become known as the Middle Passage, during which okra and other African crops became especially important as sources of sustenance in the  <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="30.0364,-90.4134"> America-bound </span> ships. [^Ref 11] Chris Smith traces the first accounts of okra’s arrival across the Atlantic in South America in the 1600s, before its arrival in North America at the ports of Charleston and New Orleans a century later. [^Ref 12] The details of okra's journey across the Atlantic, however, remain unclear, with some family oral histories suggesting that enslaved individuals hid the seeds of the plant in their hair. Jessica B. Harris and Chris Smith, however, argue that such transports would have been unlikely; rather than enslaved individuals hiding and carrying the crops and seeds, it would have been the enslavers and traders who most likely brought okra and other African crops with the people they displaced to ensure that that captives would eat and survive the Middle Passage. [^Ref 13] In this way, okra’s initial journey to the Americas was also one of force that ensured “slave owner control” over the individuals they enslaved. [^Ref 14] Nevertheless, in the Americas, okra and other African crops would become a means of reclamation against that forced displacement through the expression of an African past and identity in gardens and kitchens.

Okra thrived alongside other African crops in the gardens of the enslaved across the Americas. [^Ref 15] These gardens were sites of intercultural meetings between African, Indigenous, and European traditions. While the practice of cultivating gardens was certainly not allowed in all plantations across the Americas, in the places where such plots were allotted to enslaved communities, these gardens became sites of physical and spiritual survival. As Michael W. Twitty notes, the gardens of the enslaved often became sites of religious significance, featuring such mystical “power objects” as “shells,” other “charms,” and “conjure bags,” which embodied the fusion of African, Indigenous, and European traditions in the material used. [^Ref 16] There was also the physical necessity for food that the gardens sustained. In many cases, plantation owners provided little food to their enslaved workers, and the alloted plots that became community gardens were necessary sites of cultivation to ensure physical survival in places where “food supplies were chronically scarce.” [^Ref 17] Okra played an important role in these gardens, as it was one of the main crops cultivated, and this cultivation in the gardens of the enslaved was referenced by a number of early modern botanists and travelers to the Americas.

One early reference comes from Willem Piso, a Dutch physician and naturalist who documented okra on a Brazilian plantation in 1658. Piso emphasized the important function gardens played not only in physically sustaining enslaved communities but also in connecting them back to their homeland: “Just as the Europeans sometimes brought plants and fortunes, [...] so too the Africans, among the usual herbs brought here for study, even now nourish themselves [with plants] such as quigombo and sesame.” [^Ref 19] This connection also lives through language, as Piso employs the term quigombo for okra, a name originating in the Kimbundu language of Angola. [^Ref 20] In 1707, Hans Sloane also mentioned okra as a staple, both as food and medicine, growing in the  plots tended by the enslaved in Jamaica. [^Ref 21] In particular, he uses the term “Gardens” to describe these spaces where the enslaved cultivated their own crops. [^Ref 22] By the end of the century, in 1792, okra had become one of the most prevalent crops among the African diaspora, with the English captain Hugh Crowe noting the prevalence of the vegetable as being “well-known” in the ports of Africa and the Americas and as an “ingredient in making soup” in the West Indies. [Ref 23] Already, okra was leaving a mark in the written colonial record, transferring from the gardens and kitchens of the African diaspora to the greater American culinary scene.

While okra thrived in the gardens of the enslaved, the plant does not seem to have flourished in European kitchens in the same way. Early modern botanical writers such as Charles de L’Ecluse connect the crop’s origins to earlier Italian sources referencing Egypt. [^Ref 24] In terms of use of the okra, early modern botanists also primarily linked the plant to the gardens and the cuisines of enslaved Africans. When they did talk about cultural transference, they focused on okra moving between enslaved Africans and Indigenous peoples of the Americas. For example, Piso notes that Indigenous communities in Brazil began cultivating and preparing the crops enslaved Africans brought. [^Ref 25] At the same time, there is evidence that Europeans living in plantation societies began to adopt okra into their diets. For example, Sloane hints at the European adoption of okra in seventeenth-century Jamaica. As he writes, the plant was “very carefully planted by Europeans, as well as Slaves in their Gardens.” [^Ref 26] Indeed, the major role that enslaved individuals played in the agricultural and culinary development of the Americas would lead to the proliferation of okra in colonial kitchens, especially in the colonies of the American South and the Caribbean. [^Ref 27]

# The Significance of The Kitchen 
Another legacy of okra involves James Hemings, the head chef at Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello plantation. Though he only arrived at the plantation as a boy among the many other enslaved persons living and working in Monticello, Hemings proved over time to be adept at culinary work. By 1784, the Jeffersons rewarded his culinary skills by having him accompany them to Europe and instructing the young chef to attend a Parisian cooking school. Upon the completion of his education, Hemings returned to the United States and became the first person to introduce several French dishes there. [^Ref 28]

Though limited, the recognition Hemings received for his work was highly uncommon, given that he was an enslaved person. In fact, white enslavers in the South historically tried to deny the contributions African Americans made to their cuisine. For instance, Mary Randolph’s *The Virginia House-wife,* [^Ref 29] a highly regarded cookbook from 1824, in part claimed the techniques, practices, and recipes of the enslaved people doing this domestic work without ever acknowledging their contributions.

 	region="15,69,618,577">

After the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, the deep knowledge of okra that African Americans had began to come into clearer view. In 1918, George Washington Carver, an agricultural scientist born into slavery, also contributed his own okra recipe to the culinary record, in which he combined the sliced vegetable with tomatoes, rice, and other vegetables to make a soup. By that point, Carver had already made lasting contributions to American agricultural science, namely through his scientific studies of agricultural practices connected to the cultivation of okra and other community garden crops, [^Ref 30] as well as ways through which okra fibers could be used to make “rugs” and “rope.” [^Ref 31] In Carver’s personal writings and correspondence, his knowledge of okra is particularly striking, recurring in letters from 1907-1914 between himself and fellow American botanist Louis Herman Pammel. [^Ref 32] In response to one of Pammel’s letters, Carver explained why he would not be able to send him okra right away: “We are just planting Okra down here, so therefore I cannot [give] any of the green plants for at least a month, and up to date I have been unable to find the dry stalks, I will continue to look and if I can get any will forward them to you with pleasure.” [^Ref 33] Carver’s letter highlights his familiarity with the okra cultivation process. In particular, he emphasizes the month-long growing cycle of the plant, which on average requires approximately 55 days to produce fruit. [^Ref 34] During this time, the plant usually rises to a height of four and a half feet and a branch width of two to three feet. [^Ref 35] Along with the short harvest time, okra also prefers a warmer climate although, as Smith indicates, it can indeed grow in more northern regions with careful handling and preparation. [^Ref 36] Okra is also quite resilient against drought, though limited water negatively impacts the fruit’s quality and development. [^Ref 37]

Despite the significant scientific and culinary achievements reached by African Americans such as George Washington Carver, by the 1930s, the entertainment and advertising businesses began promoting a contradictory image of Black people and their culinary contributions. [^Ref 38] In other words, these stereotypes downplayed the generations of forced labor and cultural knowledge required to foster the culinary skills and influence actually possessed by African Americans. In the wake of the Civil Rights Movement, however, Black communities began to take  matters of representation into their own hands to contest racist mischaracterizations. In the 1960s and 1970s, soul food dishes such as fried okra began to surge in popularity again due to a wave of African Americans migrating up north. [^Ref 39] The longing for old foodways birthed a movement of Black-authored soul food cookbooks like Hattie Rhinehart-Griffin’s 1969 Soul-Food Cookbook, which called for recipes and ingredients that epitomized home, which referred both to the South and to Africa. For instance, Rhinehart-Griffin’s take on fried okra [^Ref 40] simultaneously pays homage to both her African and Southern roots.

Today, Black chefs are taking this message of reconnecting with history and the past further by expanding the idea of ‘Black food.’ [^Ref 41] Famed chef Marcus Samuelsson pays tribute to modern Black chefs, creatives, and food historians in his cookbook The Rise: Soul of American Food, which includes dishes that represent the large catalog of Black cuisine. [^Ref 43] Noteworthy among them is his take on a southern tradition with the “Leah Chase Gumbo” recipe, which he named in honor of American chef Leah Chase. By giving credit to Chase, Samuelsson underscores the complex network and history of diverse, nutritional, and delicious recipes crafted by Black chefs.

Half a century later, Black chefs are still working to reclaim their culinary traditions by publishing new cookbooks and recipes highlighting different regional takes on okra. For example, the Gullah Geechee matriarch Emily Meggett published a 2022 cookbook entitled Gullah Geechee Home Cooking with the aim of honoring her ancestry and repairing her peoples’ relationship with cooking and harvesting food. To do so, Meggett calls on okra, black-eyed peas, corn, and other foods to illuminate the beauty of traditional African American cuisine and to remind her readers that “before we were American, before we were enslaved, we were a people with an identity and culture that worked in collaboration with the earth, and benefited from its offerings.” The reverence for African American culinary knowledge and history Meggett displays in her cookbook exemplifies the very attitude the soul food movement hoped to foster: one of respect and admiration for the food that helped them navigate a traumatic past.

# Conclusion: The People's Vegetable
Through farming, cooking, and eating, centuries of African Americans have reinforced the strength and conviction necessary in the wake of so much hardship. Okra acts as one of the closest connections to life in Africa, a life that was ripped away from so many. And, with the help of its cultivators, it came to thrive. In one final example of okra’s persistence, it is worth mentioning that okra was included in the New York Botanical Garden’s African American Garden, which first opened in 2022. One of the garden’s overall purposes was to highlight the fact that “the African American world of plants, like African life in the North American world, was one of adaptation and transformation.” This is exactly the case with okra, which traveled with the African diaspora, and helped them survive, as they made their way across Americas and across time.
