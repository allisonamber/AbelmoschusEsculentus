# The Fighting Okra
Delta State University in Mississippi has an unusual mascot: the “Fighting Okra.” Previously, DSU’s mascot had been the “Statesman.” Yet students insisted on having a mascot that they thought better represented their southern roots and the toughness of their athletes. [^Ref 1] Today, DSU has proudly made the Fighting Okra the face of its campus, with promotional materials proclaiming somewhat tongue in cheek, “Fear of the Okra may not be actual fear, but it’s enough to get a crowd going.” [^Ref 2]  Although the link between okra, the South, and toughness may seem obscure,  the okra has been not just a vegetable but a source and symbol of strength for many disenfranchised communities and particularly members of the African diaspora in the Americas. In fact, videos such as the one depicting the Fighting Okra pushing a DSU swimmer into shortening her lap time epitomize the mythos surrounding the okra. Okra has developed a reputation as a “robust, productive, fast-growing, [and] high yielding [crop]... [one that is] seldom felled by pests and diseases. It adapts to difficult conditions and can thrive where other food plants prove unreliable.”  More broadly, it has served as an example of and testament to cultural resilience, as Africans forcibly displaced by the slave trade kept growing and cooking okra and preserving, as well as innovating, their culinary traditions. Thus, the crop has evolved into a cultural phenomenon that communities around the world continue to ‘stick to’ as a treasured reminder of home, heritage, and enduring spirit.

While Okra doesn’t always have the best reputation–often due to misconceptions about its slimy texture–depictions of the globetrotting vegetable are never severed from its strength and dependability.  So much so, approximately twenty years ago Mississippi’s Delta State University’s student body collectively rejected the school’s official mascot ‘the Statesman.’ Instead, the students called for a new mascot, one that paid homage to their southern roots and represented their teams athletic prowess. Although the university didn’t initially take to the mighty vegetable eventually this would change as the ‘Fighting Okra’ became the face of various campus activities, locations, and practices. In recent years, the adoption of the okra as their mascot has garnered interest in the small southern university with videos of the Fighting Okra going viral online. Videos such as the Fighting Okra pushing a DSU swimmer into a faster lap time with interestingly intimidating threats thereby exemplifying the mythos surrounding the okra. And DSU isn’t alone, in fact, okra’s biological characteristics have inspired cultures internationally for centuries. In fact, DSU’s mascot is emblematic of a larger historical relationship communities around the world have with this easy-to-grow, highly diverse plant from this fruit to flower. The Lost Crops of Africa describes the okra as the “perfect villager’s vegetable” because it’s “robust, productive, fast-growing, high yielding, and seldom felled by pests and diseases. It adapts to difficult conditions and can thrive where other food plants prove unreliable”. In other words, okra’s dependable biological characteristics has inspired profound respect for the vegetable for centuries. In turn, okra has become indispensable from its ties to home, heritage, and community strength. Thus, despite its ticklish fibers and sticky slimy texture, the crop has evolved into a cultural phenomenon that communities around the world continue to ‘stick to’ as a treasured reminder of home, heritage, and community strength.

# Origins
Okra (from the Igbo word okuru), or by its scientific name Abelmoschus escultenus, is a cultigen or a plant species that humans have selected for cultivation with no discernable wild ancestor. Okra hails from the Mallow family, sharing ties with plants such as hibiscus and cotton. In appearance, okra very closely resembles the hibiscus plant, and it was often mistaken for hibiscus in early botanical texts. Okra rises from the ground and branches into green leaves and pale yellow and red flowers, complemented by long green vegetable sprouts that hold seeds within. The plant’s premodern zone of cultivation is based in the tropics and subtropics of the eastern hemisphere, extending from Southeast Asia to West Africa. In terms of its precise origins, scientists have often theorized it to be the descendant of an older species originating in either East Africa or South and Southeast Asia. Chris Smith suggests that the Asian origin story is the more likely one as the “wild relative” of okra to which its East African origin is often attributed also grew in adjacent regions of Asia in prehistory. In spite of these theories, okra’s precise origins remain unknown. Regardless, African communities extending from the Horn of Africa to the shores of West Africa have cultivated the plant for thousands of years. From Africa, we can begin to trace okra’s journey from prehistoric cultivation to an international symbol of African diasporic survival, resilience, and cultural continuity.

# Crossing Borders
Okra's historical basis in Africa begins with its first appearance in the written record through the Arabic language as bamiya in Ibn al-Baytar’s 1216 pharmaceutical text Kitāb al-Jāmiʿ li-Mufradāt al-Adwiya wa-l-Aghdhiya. In this text, he compiled a catalog of 1400 plants, including information about their characteristics and their traditional uses. For okra’s description, Al-Baytar referenced the words of his teacher,  Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, who encountered the vegetable on a visit to Egypt in 1216 CE. He compared the plant and its “black” and “sweet” fruit to hibiscus trees in Al-Andalus. This comparison was particularly inspired by the red center that both flowers share as well as the shape and form of the flower itself. particularly references the red of its flowers. The textended with a culinary emphasis, describing how “the people of Egypt'' ate and prepared bamiya with meat and “hot spices.” Today, a comparable dish called bamiya (in Egypt and Western Asia) or ganaouiya (in Northwest Africa) is still cooked and eaten. In this enduring culinary tradition, cooks continue to pair the vegetable with protein in a slow-cooked and highly spiced stew.

Okra’s journey from Africa to the Americas begins in the decades following Columbus’ 1492 arrival in the Americas and the subsequent establishment of European colonies. From that period onward, European traders began buying captured Africans and forcibly displacing them to the Americas during the Transatlantic Slave Trade. The harrowing journey from Africa to the Americas, which would become known as the Middle Passage, during which okra and other African crops became especially important as sources of sustenance and survival in the America-bound ships. Chris Smith traces the first accounts of okra’s arrival across the Atlantic in South America in the 1600s, before its arrival in North America at the ports of Charleston and New Orleans a century later. The details of okra's journey across the Atlantic, however, remain unclear with some family oral histories suggesting that enslaved individuals hid the seeds in their hair. Jessica Harris and Chris Smith, however, argue that such transports would have been unlikely; rather than enslaved individuals hiding and carrying the crops and seeds, it would have the enslavers and traders who would have brought okra and other African crops with the people they displaced to ensure that that captives would eat and survive the Middle Passage. In this way, okra’s initial journey to the Americas was also one of force that ensured “slave owner control” over the individuals they enslaved; however, in the Americas, okra and other African crops would become a means of reclamation against that forced displacement through the expression of an African past and identity in gardens and kitchens.

Okra thrived alongside other African crops in the gardens of the enslaved across the Americas, with the practice of community botanical gardens beginning in the West Indies before spreading to the North American colonies. These gardens were sites of intercultural meetings between African, Indigenous, and European traditions. While the practice of cultivating gardens was certainly not allowed in all plantations across the Americas, in the places where such plots were allotted to enslaved communities, these gardens became sites of physical and spiritual sustenance and survival. As Michael W. Twitty notes, the gardens of the enslaved often became sites of spiritual significance, featuring mystical “power objects” such as “shells,” other “charms,” and “conjure bags,” embodying the fusion of African, Indigenous, and European traditions in the material culture of the space. Alongside this spiritual sustenance, there was also the very physical necessity of food and sustenance. In many cases, plantation owners provided little to no sustenance to their enslaved workers, and so the alloted plots that became community gardens became necessary sites of cultivation to ensure the physical survival in places where “food supplies were chronically scarce.” Okra played a primary role in these gardens, so much so that early botanists and travelers to the Americas noted the prevalence of the crop among the African diaspora.

Okra’s place in these gardens begins in Brazil with Willem Piso, a Dutch Physician and Naturalist, documenting the plant on a plantation in 1658.. In particular, he emphasized the important function these gardens played in not only physically sustaining enslaved communities but also connecting them back to their homeland in Angola: “Just as the Europeans sometimes brought plants and fortunes, [...] so too the Africans, among the usual herbs brought here for study, even now nourish themselves [with plants] such as quigombo and sesame.” This connection also lives through the language as rather than using a Latinized scientific name, Piso, employs the term quigombo, a name originating in the Kimbundu language of Angola. In 1707, Hans Sloane also mentioned okra as a staple, both as food and medicine, in the community gardens of the enslaved in Jamaica. In particular, he uses the term “Gardens” to describe these spaces where the enslaved cultivated their own crops, and he also hints at the “Europeans” adoption of okra as the plant was “very carefully planted by Europeans, as well as Slaves in their Gardens.” By the end of the century, in 1792, okra has become one of the most important crops among the African diaspora, with the English captain Hugh Crowe noting the prevalence of the vegetable as being “‘well-known’”in the ports of Africa and the Americas and as an “‘ingredient in making soup’” in the West Indies. Already, okra was leaving a mark in the written colonial record, transferring from the gardens and kitchens of the African diaspora to the greater America culinary scene.

# The Significance of The Kitchen 
One such legacy is that of James Heming, the head chef at President Jefferson’s Monticello plantation. Though he only arrived at the plantation as a boy among the many other enslaved persons living and working in Monticello. With time Hemings proved to be most adept with culinary work. By 1784, the Jeffersons rewarded his great culinary skills by accompanying them to Europe and instructing the young chef to receive proper education from a Parisian cooking school. Upon the completion of his education Hemings would not only be the first American to do so, but it would also result in him introducing several French dishes into the United States.

Though limited in comparison to his white counterparts, the warm reception Hemings received for his work was highly uncommon for an enslaved person. In fact, the Old South historically tried to deny the contributions African Americans have made to their cuisine. For instance, the highly regarded American cookbook, _The Virginia House-wife_, in part claimed the techniques, practices, and recipes of the enslaved people doing this housework without ever acknowledging their contributions.

In 1918, George Washington Carver, an agricultural scientist born during enslavement, also contributed his own okra recipe to the culinary record. By that point, Carver had already made lasting contributions to American agricultural science, namely through his scientific studies of agricultural practices connected to the cultivation of okra and other community garden crops, as well as ways through which okra fibers could be used to make “rugs” and “rope.” In Carver’s personal writings and correspondences, his love of okra is particularly striking, recurring in letters from 1907-1914 between himself and fellow American botanist Louis Herman Pammel. In Carver’s 1918 okra recipe, he combines the sliced vegetable with tomatoes, rice, and other vegetables to make a soup.

Despite the significant scientific and culinary achievements reached by African Americans like Malinda Russell and George Washington Carver, by the 1930s the entertainment and advertising businesses began pushing a very contradictory image of Black people. One notable figure that would emerge from minstrelsy, is the racist caricature of a Black cook, Aunt Jemima. Aunt Jemima is a ‘mammy’ created by, who is now known as, the Pearl Milling Company spanning nearly 100 years to sell recipes and cooking products to a largely white customer base. Implicitly selling customers the notion, as James Beard winning food historian Toni Tipton-Martin claims, the culinary labor required for their products is easy enough for a slave to do. Thereby undermining the generations of forced labor and cultural knowledge required to foster the culinary skills misrepresented by white media.

However, in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement Black communities took matters in their own hands to contest this gross misrepresentation. In the later 1960s into the 1970s soul food dishes such ‘fried okra’ began to surge in popularity again due to a wave of African Americans migrating up north. The longing for home birthed a movement of Black authored soul food cookbooks like Hattie Rhinehart-Griffin’s 1969 _Soul-Food CookBook_ which called on recipes and ingredients that epitomized ‘home.’ For instance, Rhinehart-Griffin’s take on fried okra simultaneously pays homage to both her African and Southern roots.

# Honoring Ancestry
Today, Black chefs are taking this message a bit further by expanding the zeitgeist’s idea of ‘Black food.’ Famed chef, Marcus Samuelsson, pays tribute to modern Black chefs, creatives, and food historians in his cookbook _The Rise: Soul of American Food_, with dishes that represent the large catalog of Black cuisine. Noteworthy among them is his take a southern tradition with the “Leah Chase Gumbo” recipe in honor of American chef, Leah Chase, in which Samuelsson crafts a classic dish with okra at the center. Thus, his work underscores the complex network of diverse, nutritional, and delicious recipes crafted by Black chefs.

Half a century later, Black chefs are still working to undo the damage done by racist caricatures like Aunt Jemima and the widespread generational trauma in taking up the culinary work once done against their ancestor’s will. The famed Gullah Geechee matriarch, Emily Meggett, published her 2022 cookbook with the aim of honoring her ancestry and repairing her peoples’ relationship with cooking and harvesting food. To do so, Meggett calls on okra, black-eyed peas, corn, and others to illuminate the beauty of traditional African American cuisine and to remind her readers, “before we were American, before we were enslaved, we were a people with an identity and culture that worked in collaboration with the earth, and benefited from its offerings.”  The reverence Meggett displays in her cookbook therefore exemplifies the very attitude the soul food movement hoped to foster–one of respect and admiration for the food that helped them navigate a traumatic past.

# Conclusion: The People's Vegetable
Through farming, cooking, and eating centuries of African Americans have reinforced the strength and conviction necessary in the wake of so much hardship. Okra acts as one of the closest connections to life in Africa, a life that was ripped away from so many, and with the help of its cultivators in the American South it came to thrive. The New York Botanical Garden unveiled the African American Garden: Remembrance & Resilience at their Edible Academy to honor African American history through a plant lens. The garden walk includes eight distinct beds with different plants that speak to a different aspect of their story: In The Beginning, Greens, Grains, Cookpot, Making & Mending, Out in the Wild, Curing & Conjuring, and Remembrance & Resilience. Two of which, ‘The Cookpot’ and the ‘Curing & Conjuring’ the former of which is described as an homage to cooking through ‘Old World’ and ‘New World’ feature crops such as okra.
