# The Fighting Okra
Allie Par. 1: While not officially recognized by the University, students, staff, and fans of Delta State University in Mississippi alike have lovingly adopted the 'Fighting Okra' as the school's mascot.

Allie Par. 2: Okra as a cultural phenomenon. Twitty, "we had gumbo for every season and every occasion. meatless gumbos for Lent, gumbos for duck, crawfish, shrimp, oysters, whatever was in season; filé gumbo when there was no okra, okra gumbo when there was no filé--gumbos for weddings, for funerals [...] it told you what time it was" (Twitty 196) [^Ref 1].

# Okra: The Globetrotter
Mary Par. 1: As an orphaned plant there is no officially origin attributed to Okra, but there is a strong history of its presence and culturally significance in Asia and Africa. Timeline will be inserted below.

Allie Par. 4: This paragraph will tackle the ‘mammy’ trope in film, media, and culture. With examples such as Hattie McDaniel’s Oscar winning performance in Gone With the Wind and Aunt Jemima I will break down the history of these figures and what they mean for Black communities–particularly in the context of this stereotype being used to both mock and maintain white supremist ideology.

	region="26,-38,610,570">

Allie Par. 5: Following the history present in the previous paragraph, this paragraph will explore this racist dogma in action through the erasure of Black voices. I will draw on America’s first Southern cookbooks, their authors, their audiences, and the elephant in the room. This paragraph will draw heavily from Tipton-Martin’s historiography of African American cook books. I will also talk about how the Black community, mostly Black women, created much of what is associated with Southern cuisine and values to give credit where credit is due. There will also be mention of the first book by an African American ever (see final source). Okra as a staple ration on slave ships to keep enslaved peoples alive, common enslaved peoples private gardens and businesses, a reminder of home. Twitty states, "the Old South is a place where people use food to tell themselves who they are, and to tell stories about where they've been" (Twitty xii). And "In cooking, the style of southern food is more verb than adjective; it is the exercise of specific histories, not just the result" (8).

# Traditional Culinary Practices and Culture
Allie Par. 6: Here I would like to dive into the history of the Gullah Geechee people who are often cited as helping define the African American dialect–including the term ‘Okra’ as we know it today. Taking from Megget’s cook books and sources on the Gullah peoples’ experiences under slavery and the doors their work opened for future generations. This paragraph will also set up the difficult relationship with farming and cooking that both Megget and Twitty discuss in their respective works. As well as themes of ancestral knowledge and reconnecting with the Earth through food.

Allie Par. 7: Following the thread presented in the previous paragraph, this one aims to discuss the benefits of mending one’s relationship with the past through the Earth. How cooking can heal physically, but more importantly in this context, emotionally. Connecting with your ancestry and dispelling stereotypes. This paragraph will gather everything from the last section and this section thus far to show ‘both sides of the nutmeg’ and ground our story. Touching on culture/community/the European hegemony/independence/the agricultural revolution.

Allie Par. 8: The many evolutions of okra soup, its cultural significance, and the gumbo debate in the South. Okra soup + Gumbo and Pepper Pot + Gnaouia and Bamia + Bhindi dishes (perhaps this section could talk about how okra continues to be an essential dish in the places where it was historically cultivated and eaten).

Malek Par. 4: Perhaps this paragraph can be an extension of the first one; since medicine was a big focus in our research or the plant's potential health benefits, could we discuss some studies here that connect to those points? Image needed.

# Conclusion: The People's Vegetable
Malek Par. 6: Perhaps a discussion on how okra’s historical life-saving and life-giving qualities can become modes for us to look towards our present and future. Image needed.
