# The Fighting Okra
Allie Par. 1: While okra does not always have the best reputation–often due to its slimy texture–the globetrotting vegetable is never stripped from its strength and resilience. So much so, that approximately twenty years ago Delta State University in Mississippi rejected their official mascot the ‘Statesman’ to adopt the ‘Fighting Okra.’ Initially, the University did not take to the mighty vegetable, but now many of the institution's programs and activities are centered around their unofficial mascot such as the ‘Okra Kard’ meal plan, ‘Fighting Okra Records,’ a student-run university record label, and ‘Okra Out,’ the annual pride celebration. The student body of DSU called for a new mascot, one that represented their southern roots, and their attitude on the court, and there was no better candidate than the Fighting Okra. Taking the suggestion in stride, the university won the hearts of their students and the college sports community at large with videos of the Fighting Okra going viral. These videos highlight the school and their athletes but also exemplify the mythos surrounding the okra plant: one of determination, of grit, and of strength. And they are not alone in this perception, in fact, okra has a long biological and cultural history embodying the very characteristics DSU portrays in their mascot. The okra itself is an easy to grow, highly diverse plant useful from flower to fruit that has acted as a staple in kitchens around the world. Chris Smith, in his book dedicated to okra, calls on an excerpt from the Lost Crops of Africa, “A perfect villager’s vegetable, okra (Abelmoschus esculentus, Malvaceae) is robust, productive, fast-growing, high yielding, and seldom felled by pests and diseases. It adapts to difficult conditions and can thrive where other food plants prove unreliable” (Smith 10). This is especially true during migration–both voluntary and forced. From its cultivators in Africa, Asia, and the United States, okra has long been a staple for many of these travelers’ diets. Despite its ticklish fibers and sticky slimy texture, the crop has evolved into a cultural phenomenon that communities around the world continue to ‘stick to’ as a treasured reminder of home, heritage, and community strength.

# Crossing Borders
Malek Par. 1: Okra’s earliest days are hard to track, as the plant is a cultigen, meaning it has been cultivated by humans for so long that its point of origin remains unknown. Okra, or by its scientific name Abelmoschus esculentus, is often theorized to be the descendant of an older species originating in either East Africa or South and Southeast Asia. Chris Smith suggests that the Asian origin story is the more likely one as the “wild relative” of okra to which its origin is often attributed, also grew in regions of Asia during the same period (Chris Smith 12). This transregional and transcontinental origin story further emphasizes that okra has long and prehistoric ties in both Asia and Africa that extend beyond the written record. All the same, for this narrative, okra’s African story and its journey to the Americas will be the focus as a story of African survival, resilience, and cultural continuity across time and space.

Malek Par. 2: Okra first entered the written record through Arabic as bamiya in the 1216 pharmaceutical text Kitāb al-Jāmiʿ li-Mufradāt al-Adwiya wa-l-Aghdhiya. In it, Ibn al-Baytar, an Andalusian botanist, physician and scientist, compiled a catalog of 1400 plants, including information about their characteristics and their traditional uses. For okra’s description, Al-Baytar referenced the words of his teacher,  Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, who encountered the vegetable on a visit to Egypt in 1216 CE (Smith 12). He compared the plant and its “black” and “sweet” fruit to hibiscus trees in Al-Andalus and particularly references the red of its flowers. This section ended with a culinary emphasis, describing how “the people of Egypt'' ate and prepared bamiya with meat and “hot spices” (Al-Baytar 111). Today, a comparable dish called bamiya (in Egypt and Western Asia) or ganaouiya (in Northwest Africa) is still cooked and eaten. In this enduring culinary tradition, cooks continue to pair the vegetable with protein in a slow-cooked and highly spiced stew.

Malek Par. 3: In the decades following Columbus’ 1492 arrival in the Americas and establishment of European colonies, European traders began buying captured Africans and forcibly displacing them to the Americas. This harrowing journey would become known as the Middle Passage, lasting up until the mid-eighteenth century (National Park Service: The Middle Passage). During this Middle Passage, okra and other African crops became especially important as sources of sustenance and survival in the  <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="30.0364,-90.4134"> America-bound </span> ships (Carney and Rosomoff 124). Upon arrival, the enslaved would bring okra and other crops with them as they were sold into their new lives, and these crops would remerge in the gardens cultivated by the newly arrived African communities. While the emergence of these gardens greatly emphasized enslaved peoples’ struggle to survive forced displacement, it also became a means for African reclamation and identity, which would extend across generations through food and knowledge.

Malek Par. 4: These gardens are a testament to the knowledge of plants and cultivation that African communities brought to the Americas (C & R 123), and they would appear in transregional contexts spanning from Brazil to the Carolinas. Willem Piso in particular documented okra’s appearance in the gardens he witnessed in Brazil (209-10). Additionally, he notes the important function these gardens played in not only physically sustaining enslaved communities but in also connecting them back to their homeland in Angola. This connection also lives through the language as rather than using a Latinized scientific name, Piso, employs the term quigombo, a name originating in the Kimbundu language of Angola (Mphande 107). Hans Sloane also mentioned okra as a staple, both as food and medicine, of the community gardens of the enslaved in Jamaica (223). The necessity of these gardens and the difficulties of their cultivation cannot be stressed enough (Carney and Rosomoff 126); all the while, these gardens were not only a means to survive displacement but to also remember the Middle Passage and the lands left behind in Africa. This enduring legacy is seen across and beyond the period of enslavement, through enduring culinary traditions and agricultural practice.

# The Significance of The Kitchen 
Allie Par. 2: Such a connection is exemplified through the achievements of famed enslaved cook James Hemings. Hemings arrived at the Jefferson plantation in Monticello, Virginia at nine along with his mother and siblings. With time, the young man proved to be particularly valuable in the kitchen where his culinary creations betrayed great skill and promise. Thus, upon the President’s trip to Europe in 1784, the Jeffersons’ instructed Heming to travel to Paris and receive a proper education in French cooking. His success in doing so would mark the first time any American, but especially an African American with no knowledge of the French language, earned this accreditation. The knowledge Hemings brought with him back home blossomed into a long and highly regarded culinary career allowing for the introduction of french fries, ice cream, macaroni-and-cheese, crème brûlée, and other French culinary staples to the States.

Allie Par. 3: While the Old South’s identity was built on the backs of enslaved families, farmers, caregivers, and fieldhands, their work was often appropriated by their white counterparts. White women such Mary Randolph were trailblazers in the developing a new literary genre–cookbooks–with her 1824 book The Virginian House-Wife which outlines tips and tricks to aid women in their home-keeping, child-rearing, and Southern cooking endeavors. While extremely influential at the time, the book failed to make any mention of the other women in the room, the enslaved Black people bearing the bulk of the burden. As Egerton notes, “it was rare for the [cook] books to acknowledge Blacks’ presence at all [...] But, in fact, their contributions were enormous–and the more latitude they were given to cook creatively and to manage kitchens, the more their excellence blossomed” (Egerton X). Though today, several historians have noted this oversight in early cookbooks and have made efforts to return credit to the many African-born dishes and practices that define the South. Additional mention of the first cookbook by an African American woman.

Malek Par. 5: In 1918, George Washington Carver, an agricultural scientist born during enslavement, also contributed his own okra recipe to the culinary record. By that point, Carver had already made lasting contributions to American agricultural science, namely through his scientific studies of agricultural practices connected to the cultivation of okra and other community garden crops (Carney and Rosomoff 138) as well as ways through which okra fibers could be used to make “rugs” and “rope” (Smith 176)  In Carver’s personal writings (George Washington Carver In His Own Words, Second Edition 131 & 136) and correspondences, his love of okra is particularly striking, recurring in letters from 1907-1914 between himself and American botanist, Louis Herman Pammel. In Carver’s 1918 okra recipe, he combines the sliced vegetable with tomatoes, rice, and other vegetables to make a soup. This recipe appeared twice, first in its original publication Bulletin 36, April 1918: How to Grow the Tomato; 115 Ways to Prepare It and in a second edition of the same work in 1936.

Allie Par. 4: In keeping with an Old Southern tradition of minstrelsy, depictions of a buxom Black woman, the plantation’s ‘Mammy,’ tending to the kitchen offered little grace to the hardworking people forced to carry out this unethical labor. Aunt Jemima, the name and mascot of the Pearl Milling Company from its initial ad campaign in the 1930s to its rebrand in 2020. The racist caricature sold recipes and cooking products advertising to their white customers the notion that the work is easy enough for a slave to do. Therefore, as Tipton-Martin argues, “historically, the Jemima Code was an arrangement of words and images synchronized to classify the character and life’s work of our nation’s Black cooks as insignificant. The encoded message assumes that Black chefs, cooks, and cookbook authors–by virtue of their race and gender–are simply born with good kitchen instincts, diminishes knowledge, skills, and portrays them as passive and ignorant laborers incapable of creative culinary artistry” (Tipton-Martin 2).

Allie Par. 5: In the wake of the Civil Rights Movement, “‘soul food” came into vogue in the 1960s as African Americans migrating from country to city turned to comforting classic dishes that satisfied their longing for a taste of home” (Tipton-martin 80) and thereby inspiring a intact in the fight for equality. Thus, the late sixties through the seventies marks a rise in African American cookbooks returning to their ancestral roots. Cookbooks such as Hattie Rhinehart’s 1969 Soul Food Cookbook expresses the traditions and practices through food emblematic of ‘home.’ Rhinehart Griffin’s take on ‘fried okra’ can be found on page twenty five thereby honoring her culture’s African roots and Southern roots simultaneously.

# Honoring Ancestry
Allie Par. 6: The tumultuous relationship between African Americans and the kitchen quickly became a symbol of generational trauma and culturally persistent racist falsities and yet, many Black chefs, have for generations, worked to repair their community’s relationship to the kitchen. A great deal of that work has been accredited to the communities of Gullah Geechee peoples adapting their indigenous knowledge from Africa to the ‘New World.’ There is no better representation of this very work than Emily Meggett’s discussion in her Gullah GeeChee cookbook in which she states, “slavery corrupted our ancestors’ relationship with the Earth. [...] But we must remember our history beyond slavery. Before we were American, before we were enslaved, we were a people with an identity and culture that worked in collaboration with the earth, and benefited from its offerings. We are for the land, and it cared for us [...] These recipes reflect this lifelong journey, and my love of what the earth continues to give us” (Meggett 95). Here, Meggett exemplifies a reverent  attitude towards cooking and the many gifts it bestows on its practitioners between connecting them to the Earth and to their culture that has informed generations of African Americans’ language, culture, and behaviors.

Allie Par. 7: Today, Black chefs are still navigating this complex relationship with the kitchen, while still honoring their ancestry. Marcus Samuelsson’s cookbook The Rise: Black Cooks and the Soul of American Food, deeply influenced by the 2020 BLM protests, speaks to his relationship with cooking and the message he wishes to inspire in others. He emphasizes ‘The Rise’ stands on three pillars: authorship, memory, and aspiration which talk of claiming the long unacknowledged contributions to American cuisine and culture, paying respect to ancestry, and celebrating modern-day Black creatives (Samuelsson xiii). Hallmarks exemplified throughout the cookbook as Samuelsson shares recipes that pay homage to okra’s African roots with dishes such as “Leah Chase Gumbo” (Samuelsson 222). Thereby, Samuelsson threatens the centuries old stereotype of Black cooks and their cuisine, reminding readers that “black food is not monolithic” (xiii), but a complex network of diverse and delicious foods. His work demonstrates how adopting such a mentality can heal generational wounds and inspire the creativity that has been erased and undermined for far too long.

# Traditional Culinary Practices and Culture
Allie Par. 6: Here I would like to dive into the history of the Gullah Geechee people who are often cited as helping define the African American dialect–including the term ‘Okra’ as we know it today. Taking from Megget’s cook books and sources on the Gullah peoples’ experiences under slavery and the doors their work opened for future generations. This paragraph will also set up the difficult relationship with farming and cooking that both Megget and Twitty discuss in their respective works. As well as themes of ancestral knowledge and reconnecting with the Earth through food.

# Conclusion: The People's Vegetable
Allie Par. 8: Through farming, cooking, and eating centuries of African Americans have reinforced the strength and conviction necessary in the wake of so much hardship. Okra acts as one of the closest connections to life in Africa, a life that was ripped away from so many, and with the help of its cultivators in the American South it came to thrive. Thus, okra and its cultivators, cooks, and eaters share a kind of symbiosis as their individual work comes together to invigorate and inspire the other. In short, okra’s high yields and adaptable temperament gave power to the marginalized communities farming it by giving it a crop they can rely on in good times and bad. The power shared between okra and its culinary community is a unique one that has endured migration across continents and across time; it is one that demands respect, attention, and credit for all that they have achieved together in the name of home, heritage, and strength.
